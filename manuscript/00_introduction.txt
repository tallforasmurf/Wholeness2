# Introduction

## What this book is *not* about

Let's make this clear from the outset: I am very familiar with what's bad about religion. I've read the books by Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, et. al., but more than that, I know from personal experience how fundamentalism warps thinking and warps lives.

I am well aware of how religion supports a patriarchal culture that suppresses women and despises any variation from a narrow, conventional sexuality. I know how religion is used to justify violence, cruelty, and the destruction of indigenous cultures; how religious leaders cover up evil acts in their own ranks; how religions foster anti-intellectualism and ignorance. Name any evil that can be laid at the cathedral door; I've at least read about it, if not experienced it myself.

There are books that justify atheism (some on my bookshelf). There are blogs that criticize the latest religious idiocy (several in my RSS reader). If you want to see religious practices soundly bashed, there are lots places you can go. But...

*None of that is what this book is about!*

## What this book *is* about

As I explain in [Chapter One](#Chapter01), religions also dispense psychological comfort and practical supports for a healthy life of the heart and mind. Yes, I have seen at first hand the evil religion can do, but I have also watched how a devout religious practice can support, help, encourage and sometimes heal those who can believe in it.

Apologists for religion would say the benefits of religious practice flow from the belief itself, or from God himself. Do they? I don't think so. I think the goods dispensed by religion are *human* goods created by human hearts and minds, and there are secular sources for every one of them. My aim with this book is to show what those are.

Everyone cares about living a life of good quality: a generous life, a creative life, an honest life, a life that, when it is over, leaves a monument of good memories in our survivors. But for centuries, religions have made themselves the undisputed gate-keepers to knowledge of that kind of well-lived life. Want to know why you exist? How you should live? How you should behave? How to deal with death? Read the scripture, or ask your priest, rabbi, imam or minister.

Well, not so much any more. In very recent decades religious practice has begun to fade in first-world countries and the trend is accelerating[^^fading_adherence]. As religions fade out of everyday life, are we losing anything useful? And can we get it back without having to sign up to a superstition? This book is my answer to that.

## The goods of religious practice

Here is my short list of the benefits that devout people get from their religious practices:

* The comfort of *existential validity* -- in plain language, assurance that you are not an accident, but an intentional creation, with a role in a great story.

* The social and material support of a congregation of like-minded people.

* The psychological benefits of contemplative prayer and meditation.

* The emotional support of ritual in times of crisis.

* For a few, the bliss of ecstatic union with the All.

* Constant challenge to be a better person, to transcend one's limits.

* The use of a predefined ethical system.

* Fearless awareness of death and comfort in bereavement.

These are the benefits for which I mean to show secular, non-religious sources. As a skeptic by inclination and training, I have been quite selective in my search. I only tell you about things I have personally tried, or things that are documented in respected scientific journals, or things that, like the philosophy of Epicurus, are both satisfying to common sense and visibly harmless.

## Chapter summary

Here is what you'll find in the rest of the book.

* [Chapter 1](#Chapter01) says more about the good things a religious practice may give to those who devotedly practice it, and that we want to obtain in other ways.

* [Chapter 2](#Chapter02) asks what it means to be a "mere accident", and shows how contingency can be turned into triumph.

* [Chapter 3[(#Chapter03) reviews research showing how crucial human contacts are to your life and health, and points out techniques to improve them.

* [Chapter 4](#Chapter04) looks at meditation, contemplation, and prayer, and introduces simple meditation practices that have documented benefits.

* [Chapter 5](#Chapter05) shows how important ritual is in everyone's life, and suggests ways to take control of and use ritual for your own ends.

* [Chapter 6](#Chapter06) lists what's known about the mystical experience, showing that it probably is a real, though rare, state of brain function; then asks if the experience is worth pursuing.

* [Chapter 7](#Chapter07) asks how we find our heroes and models, and where we might find more and better ones.

* [Chapter 8](#Chapter08) tackles the problem of defining and justifying a personal ethical code, drawing elements from a wide range of traditions.

* [Chapter 9](#Chapter09) faces up to death and bereavement and shows ways to prepare for one and deal with the other.

* [Chapter 10](#Chapter10) looks at the research on what makes people happy, and covers some strategies for becoming more happy.

* [Chapter 11](#Chapter11) is about four radical techniques for making oneself more resilient in the face of disaster.
